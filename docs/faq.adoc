=== Why is jq-front so slow?

It is because it's written as a bash script and creates quite a lot of process an input file.
If somebody starts a project to rewrite this in Java, for instance, I would be contributing to it!

=== How is error handling designed?

`jq-front` is designed and implemented so that it stops processing on errors.
However, due to the specification of `bash`, if you use command substitution in templating and an inner call occurs an error, it CANNOT stop.

Except for that, if you think it should stop but it doesn't, please file a ticket https://github.com/dakusui/jq-front/issues[here].

On errors, you should see an output like following.
